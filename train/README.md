You can use PEFT or train your model with LLaMA_Factory, or you can train the model in full. We welcome your continued exploration. For the TIPA and MTIPA datasets, you can access them in main.py.

[LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) ```config: mine_qwen2.5_lora_sft.yaml```

Or `train_lora.py`
